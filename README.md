# Namless Oblivion Remaster Mod Manager (NORMM)

A one-stop shop mod manager, that can manage any and all sorts of mods that exist.

It got tiring to manage all the different types of mods that exist, manually having to remember all the rules for all the different types. This way, you don't have to think about it! The mod manager does it all for you.

## Currently supported mod types:
* `.esp` and `.esm` mods (called `ESP/ESM`)
* `.pak` mods (called `UnrealPak`)
* [`OBSE`](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282) mods
* [`UE4SS`](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32) mods
* [`MagicLoader`](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966) mods
* [`TesSyncMapInjector`](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272) mods
* [`NPC Appearance Manager`](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2345) mods

## Where do I get it, and how do I use it?
The user guide hub can be found [here](/docs/README.md).

I'd recommend starting with the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started.md), which goes over installation and basic usage.
