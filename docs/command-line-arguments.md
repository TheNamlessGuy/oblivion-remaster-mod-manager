# Command line arguments
NORMM has its own command line arguments, separate from those specified by Godot itself. The full list of these can be seen by specifying the `--help` flag to NORMM via the command line.

**NOTE:** All NORMM flags (including `--help`!) has to be specified after an `--`, so NORMM flags don't collide with Godot flags. See the [OS.get_cmdline_user_args](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_os.html#class-os-method-get-cmdline-user-args) spec for more info.
